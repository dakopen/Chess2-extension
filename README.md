**How to install:**
The browser extension is available in all major browsers (just to be clear, that excludes Safari). If you _must_ use chess.cðŸ¤®m, you have to disallow Chess 2 from
accessing data on that site.

**How to contribute:**
There are numerous features that need to be added to Chess 2. Here is a list of some ideas:
- il Vaticano
- double check win
- vertical castling
- ... (see full list [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnarchyChess/wiki/index/))

Most of the upcoming features need both players to play Chess 2. Then, the browser add-on can automatically draw and continue from the new position, if a special move was made.
